# Speech recognition platform using Google speech dataset
An implementation that uses the speech recognition infrastructure provided by Tensorflow and the speech commands dataset from Google.

## Audio dataset
The audio dataset was was from the Google Speech Commands Dataset compiled by the Tensorflow and AIY team. A link to the opensourced dataset was obtainedfrom a google blog post by Pete Warden (petewarden@google.com) 

More information about his implementation, the dataset and other contributions are shared through a link to his blog post presented below:

## Neural network training Infrastructure
The training infrastructure code was based on an open sourced project from tensorflow.
