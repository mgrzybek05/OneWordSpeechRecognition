# Speech recognition platform using Google speech dataset

## Neural Network Code 
The neural network code is based on work done by 

## Audio dataset 
The audio dataset was was from the Google Speech Commands Dataset compiled by the Tensorflow and AIY team. A link to the opensourced dataset was obtainedfrom a google blog post by Pete Warden (petewarden@google.com) 

More information about his implementation, the dataset and other contributions are shared through a link to his blog post presented below:

## Training Infrastructure
The training infrastructure code was based on an open sourced project from tensorflow.
