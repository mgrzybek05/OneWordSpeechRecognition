# One Word Speech recognition platform using Google speech dataset
An implementation that uses the speech recognition infrastructure provided by Tensorflow and the speech commands dataset from Google.

## Audio dataset
The audio dataset was compiled from the Google Speech Commands Dataset v0.02 by the TensorFlow and AIY team. A link to the open-sourced dataset was obtained from a Google blog post by Pete Warden (petewarden@google.com) 

More information about his implementation, the dataset and other contributions is shared through a link to his blog post presented below:

## Neural network training infrastructure basis
The training infrastructure code was based on an open-source project from Tensorflow.
